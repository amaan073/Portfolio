# My First Portfolio Project

This project was my **first attempt at building a full portfolio website**.  

- **Coding:** All code is written by me from scratch.  
- **Design:** The layout and visual style were inspired by a YouTube tutorial from [BedimCode](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HUJEhVjcEWM).  
- **Purpose:** This project was purely a **learning exercise** to practice HTML, CSS, and responsive web design.
